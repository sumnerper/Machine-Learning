        "Variance and bias have curves that go in opposite directions because of the trade off that exists between the two; more flexible models fit to every value in the data so variance of the model increases and bias decreases. The test error has a \"u\" shape because with additional flexibility, the model is unable to model the noise in the test data. The Bayes error remains flat because it is neutral and is the natural error that would exist for any model. The training error decreases with greater flexibility because as flexibility increases, the model does a better job of fitting the data. \n",
